# About Me - John S Programmer
## Who I am
I am a year 12 A level student currently studying Computer Science, Physics and Maths A Levels in BHASVIC in Brighton  

## My ambitions
I hope to become a professional programmer in the games industry, probably after either studying a Software Engineering degree or completing a degree apprenticeship. I am particuarly interested in working for [Hanger 13](https://hangar13games.com/). I am currently investigating my post 18 options    

## My technical skills
- Python - studied to GCSE, I am reasonably confident
- C - studied this for a term and completed some of the Advent of Code tasks using C
- Java - I have studied this for a term, I have used Greenfoot and experimented with a simple project using Swing
- HTML/CSS - I have used this to make some simple websites
- Unity/C# - I have used this to make some simple games

## Soft skills I have and am developing
Studying full time as well as working a part time job has quickly developed my time managment and prioritisation skills.
I work in a local McDonalds which is customer facing so I have had to develop my interpersonal and customer skills.
In college I am additionally studying for an [EPQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Project_Qualification) or Extended Project Qualification which has helped me improve my academic research skills, independent study as well as personal resiliance.

## My current projects
In my personal time I am exploring Unity tutorials as I am interested in games design and hope to use Unity for my 2nd year project
